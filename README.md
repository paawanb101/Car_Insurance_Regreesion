Customer lifetime value is a very import figure for insurance companies as it helps them to predict amount of revenue they will generate from a particular during his/her lifetime.
This helps the companies to identify profitable customers and exhaust less resources on acquiring less profitable customers. As part of this project, I will be using different Regressors and will use validation scores to identify the best one.


Aim is to predict car insurance customer lifetime value with the best suitable regressor.
In this we following task are done:
  1. Data Import
  2. Data Exploration
  3. Treating Missing Values
  4. Identify and Treat outliers
  5. Data Preprocessing
  6. Implement and Compare Multiple Regression Algorithm on the dataset
  7. Build final model with the best algorithm and hyperparameters, predict test values and compare it with actual
